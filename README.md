### Overview:

- Written and programmed in R.
- Data processing and cleaning.
- Writing functions and building new variables, predictors.
- Data analysis.
- Using machine learning to perform prediction.

### Background:

Pitchfork is one of the most widely read online music magazines. It is most famed for its album review scores and 'Best New Music' award system. It assigns a score from 0 to 10 to one decimal place for an album that is released and reviewed by one of their writers. An album which receives a score of higher than 8.0 will often receive 'Best New Music' status- an indicator that it is of particularly high quality and an award which holds a lot of influence in terms of the album's sales and credibility.

The aim of this project will be to explore a dataset of Pitchfork reviews and, ultimately, build a prediction model that attempts to predict the score an album will get when reviewed by Pitchfork.
