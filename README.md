## Introduction

Pitchfork is one of the most widely read online music magazines. It is most famed for its review scores and 'Best New Music' award system. It assigns a score from 0 to 10 to one decimal place for an album that is released and reviewed by one of their writers. An album which receives a score of higher than 8.0 will often receive 'Best New Music' status- an indicator that it is of particularly high quality and an award which holds a lot of influence in terms of the album's sales and credibility.

The aim of this project will be to explore a dataset of Pitchfork reviews and, ultimately, build a prediction model that attempts to predict the score an album will get when reviewed by Pitchfork. Below, I note some aims, expectations and points of intrigue.

- What is the average score awarded to an album and how does the distribution of scores look?

- If biases exist, where are they? Genre? Review's author? 

- My expectation is that the previous scores given to the artist will provide the best indication of score.

- What predictors can be created to improve prediction? How much can prediction accuracy be improved from using just one predictor (based on previous score(s)) to using multiple?
